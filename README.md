# Embedded-system-that-counts-presses-from-a-pressure-contact.
In this embedded system client have a reqquirement to  count pressess from a pressure contact. A pressure switch,
seven segment and three LEDs were connected to the FPGA. The LEDs display binary
count up the number of key presses. The task was verify  with some test case on the the simulator and
validate the result on the Altera FPGA DE2-115 boarad. The application is design in VHDL coding.
The following tool used in this system is
Altera FPGA DE2-115 board.
Modelsim.
Quartus II.
